## Description 📖
Spider Smash is a game written in Python using the Pygame library. This project is primarily an introduction to Pygame where I
tested and learned a lot of things, rather than a finished and polished project. The game itself is relatively simple and quickly
becomes boring because it doesn't really present a real challenge. Some parts, like the game over screen for example, haven't
been added because I didn't see anything interesting to learn from it. All graphics and audio assets are completely royalty-free
and come from websites such as itch.io or opengameart.org. You can use this project as you wish and reuse any part of the code as you please.

## Controls 🕹️
The player follows and shoots in the direction of the mouse. To shoot, press space, to sprint use the right mouse click.

## Try it out 👾
For anyone interested passing by, I've compiled an executable to make testing the 'game' easy.<br>
I used PyInstaller for this, and despite compiling it for my system, the Jiangmin antivirus still shows a false positive.<br>
Additionally, on VirusTotal, Jiangmin is the only detection out of 71 antivirus engines.<br>
So, if you don't feel like setting up a virtual environment and installing all the modules, the executable is here 🙂
